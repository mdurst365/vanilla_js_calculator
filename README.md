# About this project

This project was created in order to continue practicing my JavaScript skills outside of the OSU coding bootcamp. It uses CSS3 for styling, and HTML5 to create the calculator interface. I learned from this tutorial how to use data attributes insted of classes or ids to define areas in the HTML that I would like to manipulate in JavaScript.

# Concepts Covered in this tutorial incuded:

- How to use ES6 classes to organize code
- How to sync JavaScript code with a UI
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- The best way to cleanly handle user input
- How to debug complicated edge cases
